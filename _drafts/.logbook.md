### Bioinformatics Enthusiast and Disease Detective

I am curre
At the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, I am a dedicated bioinformatician specialising in the development and validation of cutting-edge bioinformatics pipelines for analysing pathogen genomes. My work primarily focuses on enhancing public health and surveillance systems by refining the detection, diagnosis, and treatment of infectious diseases through the power of genomic data.

I completed my PhD in Bioinformatics from La Trobe University, under the supervision of Prof Warwick Grant, Dr. Shannon Hedtke, and Dr. Rebecca Chisholm. My doctoral research was a deep dive into the spatial modelling of transmission dynamics of a neglected tropical disease, called river blindness. This experience cemented my passion for integrating diverse data types‚Äîgenomic, environmental, and epidemiological‚Äîto unravel the complexities of infectious disease spread and evolution.

My current interests lie at the intersection of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and climate change, where I leverage computational tools to explore and address pressing biological questions. Whether I'm coding in R, Python, MATLAB, or another language, I find joy in the intricate dance of data analysis and problem-solving. When not delving into bioinformatics, I enjoy reading books like "Measuring the World" by Daniel Kehlmann to keep my mind balanced and my emotions grounded.

With expertise in bioinformatic analysis, population genetics, landscape genetics, and infectious disease modelling, I am always eager to collaborate on projects that harness computational methods to advance our understanding of health and disease.

Feel free to [reach out to me](mailto:xxx@xxx.com) if you share an interest in these areas or wish to explore potential collaborations.
