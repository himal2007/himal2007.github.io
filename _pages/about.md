🔬 **Mission:** Defeating Diseases with Data
<!-- 🔍 **Role:** Bioinformatician at the Microbiological Diagnostic Unit Public Health Laboratory (MDU-PHL)
🌍 **Focus:** Pathogen Genomics in Public Health -->

**🔎 I unmask microbial villains.** At the [MDU-PHL](https://biomedicalsciences.unimelb.edu.au/departments/microbiology-Immunology/research/services/microbiological-diagnostic-unit-public-health-laboratory), I develop and validate bioinformatics pipelines that decode the genomes of infectious agents, turning complex data into actionable insights. My work is like solving intricate puzzles, where each piece of data contributes to a clearer picture of disease dynamics and helps in the fight against infectious diseases.

**🎓 My journey as a bioinformatician began at La Trobe University** under the guidance of [Prof Warwick Grant](https://scholars.latrobe.edu.au/wgrant), Dr. Shannon Hedtke, and Dr. Rebecca Chisholm. My PhD focused on the spatial modelling of river blindness, a neglected tropical disease, where I used computational tools to map out its transmission pathways and devise strategies to curb its spread.

**🔬 My expertise lies at the intersection of science and technology,** integrating genomics, environmental data, and epidemiology to tackle complex health challenges. I’m particularly passionate about exploring how antimicrobial resistance and climate change influence disease patterns.

**🌱 Curious Mind:** When I'm not delving into the molecular mysteries of pathogens, you might find me lost in the pages of a book. Currently, I'm currently reading _Why I am a Hindu_ by Shashi Tharoor, a delightful escape that keeps me balanced and inspired.
You can find the complete list of books I've read on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/himal2007).
