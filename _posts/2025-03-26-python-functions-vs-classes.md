# **[DRAFT] Python functions vs. classes for building powerful Python CLI tools with Bioinformatics examples**  

Python has been my go-to language since I started working as a bioinformatician. However, Iâ€™ve realised that I havenâ€™t used classes as much as I should have.  

In the fast-moving field of bioinformatics, Python is a top choice for building command-line interface (CLI) toolsâ€”thanks to its simplicity, rich ecosystem, and flexibility. Whether you're writing a quick script to process genomic data or developing a complex pipeline for sequence analysis, choosing between functions and classes can significantly impact your codeâ€™s efficiency, maintainability, and scalability.  

In this blog, weâ€™ll break down the key differences between functions and classes, explore when to use each, and provide real-world bioinformatics examples. Along the way, Iâ€™ll share insights into how getting comfortable with Python classes can enhance your ability to build robust CLI tools.  

## **Functions vs. classes: a visual overview**

To illustrate the fundamental difference between functions and classes, hereâ€™s a simple diagram:  

```mermaid
graph TD
  subgraph Functions
    A[Input] -->|Processed by function| B[Output]
  end

  subgraph Classes
    C[Input] -->|Processed by constructor| D[Instance with State]
    D -->|Method Call| E[Output]
  end
```

- **Functions** take an input, process it, and return an output.  
- **Classes** not only take input and produce output but also maintain a state, allowing data to persist across method calls.

## **Python functions: making your code reusable**  

One of the core principles of programming is **DRY**â€”*"Don't Repeat Yourself."* Iâ€™ve relied on functions to make my code more reusable and efficient from the start.  Functions are **straightforward and simple**. They act as self-contained blocks of code designed to perform a specific task. Functions are particularly useful when you need to repeat an operation multiple times but donâ€™t want to rewrite the same code.  They are perfect for operations that donâ€™t require maintaining state between calls.

### **Hmm... What Does "Maintaining State Between Calls" Mean?ðŸ¤”**  

When we say functions donâ€™t "maintain state between calls," it simply means that every time you call a function, it starts freshâ€”forgetting anything from previous runs. Functions take input, process it, and return an output without remembering any past data.  

For example, if you construct a function to calculate the **GC content** (the percentage of guanine and cytosine) in a DNA sequenceâ€”a common task in bioinformaticsâ€”you can use a simple function like this:  

```python
def gc_content(sequence):
    """Calculate the GC content percentage of a DNA sequence."""
    gc_count = sequence.count("G") + sequence.count("C")
    return 100 * gc_count / len(sequence)

# Usage
dna_seq = "ATGCGATACGCTTGC"
print("GC Content:", gc_content(dna_seq))
```
Here, `gc_content` is the **function name**, and `sequence` is a **parameter** that allows you to pass any DNA sequence as input. The function counts the number of **G** and **C** nucleotides in the sequence and returns the GC content percentage. `sequence.count("G") + sequence.count("C")` counts the **G** and **C** nucleotides, while `return 100 * gc_count / len(sequence)` computes and returns the GC content percentage.

Functions like this are great when you have **clear inputs and outputs** without needing to store extra data. But what if your program requires keeping track of information across multiple calls? Thatâ€™s where **classes** come inâ€”letâ€™s explore that next!  

---

## **Python classes: organising data and behavior**  

While functions are great for simple, reusable operations, **classes** take things a step further. Classes act as blueprints for creating objects that bundle both **data** and **behavior** (methods). They are incredibly useful when you want to maintain **state** between calls or model complex entities. In bioinformatics, this is particularly relevant when you need to represent biological sequences, genes, or proteins.

Imagine you're developing a **bioinformatics CLI tool** that processes various biological sequence records. Instead of passing raw data between functions, you can create a `SequenceRecord` class to encapsulate relevant properties (like the sequence ID and nucleotide string) alongside methods for operations such as **transcription** or **reverse complement calculation**.  Note it is a norm to name the class in a Pascal case, i.e. each word starts with a uppercase letter without spaces (e.g. `SequenceRecord` instead of `sequence_record`).


### **Example: using a class for sequence records**  

```python
class SequenceRecord:
    def __init__(self, identifier, sequence):
        self.identifier = identifier
        self.sequence = sequence

    def gc_content(self):
        gc_count = self.sequence.count("G") + self.sequence.count("C")
        return 100 * gc_count / len(self.sequence)

    def reverse_complement(self):
        complement = {"A": "T", "T": "A", "G": "C", "C": "G"}
        return "".join(complement[base] for base in self.sequence[::-1])

# Usage of SequenceRecord class
record = SequenceRecord("seq1", "ATGCGATACGCTTGC")

# Accessing object properties and methods
print(record)
print("Sequence:", record.sequence)
print("Identifier:", record.identifier)
print("GC Content:", record.gc_content())
print("Reverse Complement:", record.reverse_complement())
```

### **Output:**

```console
<__main__.SequenceRecord object at 0x0000023EE513CF10>
Sequence: ATGCGATACGCTTGC
Identifier: seq1
GC Content: 53.33%
Reverse Complement: GCAAGCGTATCGCAT
```

Note, when you print the `record` object by itself, it shows the memory address of the object. The class `SequenceRecord` bundles related data and methods together, making it easier to manage and manipulate sequence records. In this example, there are two methods: `gc_content` and `reverse_complement`, which operate on the sequence data stored in the object.
`record` is an **instance** of the `SequenceRecord` class, and you can call its methods to perform operations on the sequence data.
_If you want an analogy, think of a class as a form that needs to be filled out. The instance of the class is the filled-out form, which contains the data you entered._Each instance (like `record`) contains unique data but follows the same structure. By using a class, you can group related methods and state together, making it easier to manage complex workflowsâ€”especially when your CLI tool must handle multiple types of data.

## **When to use functions vs. classes**  

### **Simplicity vs. Structure**  

| Use Functions When... | Use Classes When... |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| Your task is **simple and stateless** | You need to **group related data and behavior** |
| You just need a **single reusable operation** | Your code requires **maintaining state** between calls |
| You want a **quick, lightweight approach** | You're working with **complex data structures** |
| Example: Computing **GC content** | Example: Representing **biological sequences** |

In bioinformatics, functions work best for **small, focused tasks**, while classes shine when dealing with **structured data** like **genes, proteins, or sequence records**.

## **Building CLI tools: combining functions and classes**  

Modern **Python CLI tools** often mix both approaches. Libraries like **argparse** or **Click** help process command-line arguments while keeping the core logic clean and modular. Letâ€™s look at an example:  

### **Example: FASTA file parser with a CLI**  

```python
import argparse

class FastaRecord:
    def __init__(self, identifier, sequence):
        self.identifier = identifier
        self.sequence = sequence

    def gc_content(self):
        gc_count = self.sequence.count("G") + self.sequence.count("C")
        return 100 * gc_count / len(self.sequence)

def parse_fasta(file_path):
    records = []
    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
        identifier = None
        seq_lines = []
        for line in f:
            line = line.strip()
            if line.startswith(">"):
                if identifier:
                    records.append(FastaRecord(identifier, "".join(seq_lines)))
                identifier = line[1:]  # Remove '>'
                seq_lines = []
            else:
                seq_lines.append(line)
        if identifier:
            records.append(FastaRecord(identifier, "".join(seq_lines)))
    return records

def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Process FASTA files and compute GC content.")
    parser.add_argument("fasta_file", type=str, help="Path to the FASTA file")
    args = parser.parse_args()

    records = parse_fasta(args.fasta_file)
    for record in records:
        print(f"{record.identifier}: GC Content = {record.gc_content():.2f}%")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### **How this code works**  

1. **`FastaRecord` Class:** Stores the sequence **ID** and **nucleotide string**, providing a method to compute **GC content**.  
2. **`parse_fasta` Function:** Reads a **FASTA file**, extracts sequence data, and creates `FastaRecord` objects.  
3. **`main` Function:** Uses **argparse** to accept a **file path** as input, then processes and prints GC content for each sequence in the file.  

#### **Running the CLI Tool on real data**  

```sh
# copy the python code above into a file called fasta_gc.py
nano fasta_gc.py
# download a sequence file of a sample bacterial genome of Haemophilus influenzae
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MDU-PHL/hicap/refs/heads/master/example/Hi75.fasta
# view the FASTA file
less Hi75.fasta
# run the CLI tool to compute GC content and print the first few lines of output
python fasta_gc.py Hi75.fasta | head
```

### **Sample output:**  
```console
NODE_1: GC Content = 37.41%
NODE_2: GC Content = 37.34%
NODE_3: GC Content = 37.73%
NODE_4: GC Content = 38.46%
NODE_5: GC Content = 37.63%
```

Viola! Youâ€™ve built a simple CLI tool to parse FASTA files and compute GC content and tested it on a real dataset.

With this approach, we **separate concerns**:
- **File parsing** is handled by a **function** (`parse_fasta`).
- **Sequence representation and operations** are handled by a **class** (`FastaRecord`).
- **Command-line interaction** is handled by **argparse** in the `main()` function.  

This **modular design** makes it easier to test, maintain, and extend.

If you are interested in diving deeper, there's a whole philosophy of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** built around classes. Python is a **dynamic** language that supports both **functional** and **object-oriented** programming.  

- **Some languages, like Java, are class-heavy**, forcing everything into objects.  
- **Others, like Haskell, follow a functional paradigm**, relying entirely on pure functions.  
- **Python gives you the best of both worlds**, allowing you to choose the right tool for the job.  

## **Finding the Right Balance**  

If you've been writing **large, monolithic functions**, consider **refactoring your code into classes** for better structure. However, **not everything needs to be a class**â€”sometimes, a well-designed function is the simplest and most effective approach.

## **Final Thoughts**  

Understanding the differences between **functions and classes** in Python is essential for writing **clean, efficient, and scalable bioinformatics tools**. By thoughtfully combining both, you can build **powerful CLI tools** that streamline your workflow and handle **complex biological data** with ease.
